1 - Find first optimum with modified MU
2 - Use 3D PSO to find the optimum of J = J1 + J2 with reduced search space
3 - Determine beta & gamma
4 - Use those values in classical MU / PSO 2D

If there are perturbations
1 - During MU - doesn't matter
2 - During 3D PSO - doesn't matter
3 - After 3D PSO - particles are sentinel, so it's detected
a. Evaluate the amplitude of the perturbation. If all units have the same amplitude -> same perturbation -> beta and gamma stay the same
b. Redo 3D PSO only on units that have a perturbation

Contributions
1 - A way of evaluating beta and gamma to use for the MPPT of predilection
2 - A way to reduce search space
3 - A way to reduce the dimension of PSO in dynamic systems with multiple units
